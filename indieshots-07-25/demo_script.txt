INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A young woman sits alone at her kitchen table, staring at an empty coffee cup. The silence is deafening.

SARAH looks up from the cup, her eyes red from crying. She reaches for her phone, hesitates, then puts it back down.

SARAH
(whispered)
Why did you leave?

She stands up slowly, walks to the window, and stares out at the city lights below.
